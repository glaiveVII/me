# cleaning submodules if issues on the way you have imported them :
```
rm -rf themes
git submodule add https://github.com/xxx/gohugo-theme-xxx.git themes/xxx;\
# Edit your config.toml configuration file
# and add the xxx theme.
echo 'theme = "xxx"' >> config.toml
```
donâ€™t forget to init and update the sub-module in git. 
You will then see the files locally and can tinker with them.
```
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
```
